It starts by creating an http.Client without any timeout configured. This prevents the client's timeout from interfering with the context timeout.

It then creates the GET request with the passed URL and nil body. 

A context with the required timeout is created using context.WithTimeout. This will be used to manage the timeout for the request.

The created request is updated to use the timeout context.

The request is executed using the client. Any errors sending the request are returned.

The response body is read completely and the APIResponse struct is populated with the body content as a string and status code integer.

So in summary:
- Create client without timeouts 
- Build GET request
- Apply context with timeout 
- Execute request
- Read response
- Return APIResponse with body and status

This allows making a GET request with customizable timeouts and cancellations using a context. The APIResponse encapsulates both the status code and body content.
